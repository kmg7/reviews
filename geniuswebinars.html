<span itemprop="datePublished" class="publishdate">January 31, 2018</span>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>My Genius Webinars review will assist in explaining a program that teaches you how to make remarkable earnings by selling physical items utilizing the power of Amazon. Thousands of students have actually enrolled in previous versions of Amazing Selling Machine thus proving it to be a beneficial system in getting people to purchase your items.</p>
<p>It teaches you how to get products from wholesalers and sending them through various channels to Amazon FBA so that they can be sold at a profit. What this means is that Amazon stocks your items, fulfills clients' orders, and delivers the products to the consumer. If you allow Amazon to ship your products you qualify for Amazon Prime.</p>

<h2 id="item3" itemprop="headline">Review Summary</h2>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Jason is in my opinion a webinar genius. So Genius Webinars is an apt name for this course. He has sold over $100,000,000 worth of products on his webinars. My partner and I purchased an add-on course to a popular Amazon FBA program for $3497. Without Jason's webinar I doubt we would have been so inclined to spend the money. If you have or want to sell an information product or coaching program, Genius Webinars is worth serious consideration. My rating is 5/5. This program does not open until March 1 but you can leave your name and email to be notified. Click below for access now. </p>
